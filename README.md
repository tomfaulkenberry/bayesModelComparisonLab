# Bayesian Model Comparison Lab
This is a repository of materials for a lab activity that uses Bayesian model comparison in the context of mental arithmetic.

## Background
There are two competing classes of models for cognitive processing in mental arithmetic. One such class, which we term as *additive models*, assume that number format manipulations such as "3+4" versus "three + four" only affect systems which are responsible for stimulus encoding, and thus do not have direct downstream effects on processes involved in calculation  (e.g., [Dehaene, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(92)90049-N), [McCloskey, 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(92)90052-J), [Noel, Fias, & Brysbaert, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-0277(97)00009-7)).

Another competing class of models assumes that format effects directly feed forward into systems responsible for calculation (e.g., [Campbell, 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-0277(94)90075-2), [Campbell & Fugelsang, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0010-0277(01)00115-9), [Campbell & Penner-Wilger, 2006](https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03193400).  Because such models hypothesize that format costs are modulated by problem difficulty, we term these models *interactive models*.

The purpose of this lab is to examine whether format and problem size interact in a mental addition task. Students will each collect performance data from a small number of participants (e.g., friends, family). The instructor then compiles the small datasets from each student into one large dataset for analysis. This is called *class-sourcing* the data.
